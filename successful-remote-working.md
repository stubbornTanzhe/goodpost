For both employees and employers, remote work requires intentional 
design and implementation to be effective. People find remote work 
challenging because the established mindset says that being in an 
office is how work gets done. Remote workers also need to prioritize 
their mental health, by taking breaks, getting exercise, and having 
a social life. Despite the challenges, when remote work is done well, 
the advantages to employees and employer are sufficient to make it worthwhile.

无论对于雇员还是雇主，要想使远程工作有效，需要双方有心地设计和实施。  
人们感觉远程工作很有挑战性，是因为固有的思维模式都认为，去办公室上班才是完成工作的方式。  
远程工作者还需要通过休息、锻炼和社会生活，来优先保障他们的心理健康。尽管存在挑战，  
但只要安排得当，远程工作给雇员和雇主带来的好处都足以使其值得一试。

```
The first starting point for remote employees is to have clear separation 
between home and work. This can be done through physical separation, 
by having a dedicated home office, or even working at a shared-work facility, 
such as Regus or WeWork. It is also helpful to have a transition point, 
something to replace a commute, that delineates the shift from being at home 
to being at work. Some people have found taking their dog for a walk, 
or simply going out the front door and coming in the back door of their house 
is enough to make the mental shift and start focusing on work.
```

员工在家办公，第一要务是区分家和工作。具体的区分，可以是通过物理的距离，比如搞一个专属的空间。   
也可以是通过WeWork之类的共享设施来实现。或者通过一些过渡方法，比如使用一些方式来提代日常的   
通勤，从而完成了在家的状态切换到上班的状态。有些人可以是遛遛狗，或者是简单的从前门出去，再从后门进来，  
就完成了上班的步骤，然后就开始专心工作了。  


```
Successful remote work is not just up to the employees. 
Companies and managers must make extra effort to exhibit transparency 
and establish trust, because you don’t have benefits of casual conversation 
and body language like you would working in the same location. 
Psychological safety is needed for remote working, 
and this means managers must be prepared to be vulnerable. 
Once a manager shows they are comfortable sharing something difficult, 
then employees will be more comfortable reciprocating. 
Humble said, “You have to fundamentally trust people because 
you can’t see what they do. They have to tell you.”
```

远程工作想要成功，不仅仅靠员工。公司和经理，不能像在工作地点一样，通过日常交谈和身体语言来交流，  
所以他们需要付出额外的努力去展示透明的信息，以及建立信任关系。远程工作需要心理安全感，  
这意味着经理们必须准备展示自己脆弱的一面。一旦一个经理乐于分享自己的难处，那看到的员工  
也会敞开心扉。Humble说过，你必须彻底的相信大家，因为你看不到他们所做的。得通过他们的嘴来告诉你。  


```
Establishing a high level of trust among remote managers and 
employees starts with having good meeting rituals. Meetings 
should be conducted on video if at all possible, and start 
with a “check in” for each team member. The check in lets 
people state how they are feeling that day, and what else 
is going on that may be affecting their mood or productivity. 
Managers must lead by example, because what you do is more 
important than what you say. For more suggestions on meeting 
rituals, Humble recommended the High-Performance Teams 
mini-book by Richard Kasperowski, author of The Core Protocols.
```

经理和员工的高度信任，始于一套高标准的会议仪式。如果可能的话，会议要使用视频，并且   
要每个人都签到。签到会让与会者表现出他们当天的感受，以及可能会影响到的情绪和工作状态的东西。  
经理们必须带头，因为经理们所做的比他们说的重要。更多的建议可以参见《the High-Performance Teams》  


```
An established calendar of regular meetings also helps create 
structure for distributed teams. A daily huddle takes the place 
of a “standup.” Because remote teams build a higher level of 
independence than co-located teams, this may only need to occur 
twice per week to keep everyone aligned.
```

定期的会议日程安排有助于为分散的团队建立结构。一个日常的角落可以用于站立会议。  
因为远程团队要比物理上一起的团队有更高的独立性，所以站立会议这种通常一周有2次就可以，  
来对齐每个人的事情。  

```
One-on-one meetings between employee and manager are extremely important, 
and must be treated as sacrosanct. These meetings are for the employee, 
with discussions about their career and other personal concerns. 
Humble had two absolute rules: The one-on-one is not a status meeting, 
and managers should never be allowed to cancel the meeting.
```

员工和经理一对一的会议也很重要，并且必须重视。这些一对一的会议，涉及到员工的职业生涯，以及  
其他个人关注的内容。Humble给了2个原则：一对一的会议不能是一个信息同步会议，并且经理也不能随意的取消。  


```
Strategic discussions are very challenging to have remotely, 
so these will usually occur when everyone involved can meet in person, 
which is every four months for C4, and coincides with QCon scheduling. 
C4 has an annual “all hands” meeting that lasts for four days, 
which also involves flying everyone into one location. 
This is obviously very expensive and a logistical challenge, 
but is extremely valuable. While everyone does not need to be 
co-located all the time, there are some situations which are 
only really effective when a team is all together. 
These include strategic discussions and just help re-enforce 
the bonds between team members.
```

战略性的讨论很难远程进行，通常需要见面开会。见面的会议明显是很贵的，并且对后勤也有挑战，    
但是非常值得去做的。虽然每个人不必一直在一起，但是某些时候所有人在一起时，团队的效率时非常高的。    
所以在战略性的讨论的时候，通常需要让团队成员见面，并且也能增强凝聚力。  

```
While remote work is very appealing to some employees, 
it does come with some trade-offs. Although the time and costs 
associated with commuting disappear, new costs may be incurred 
from premium high-speed internet, a good laptop, a nice desk, 
and especially a good office chair. A subject not often, 
or easily, discussed regarding remote work is mental health. 
Burnout is a real, serious issue, and is endemic in IT. 
Trust and openness is critically important, and allows 
team members to recognize when someone is struggling, 
and help them cope, including seeking professional help. 
Loneliness can also be a problem, and it takes active effort 
to make your family and your social life a real priority. 
Pets, exercise, and getting into nature can also help improve 
mental well-being.

虽然远程工作对某些员工非常有吸引力，但有得必有失。  
与上下班相关的时间和财务成本消失了，但是会产生新的成本，比如去购置高速上网服务、  
好的笔记本电脑、漂亮的办公桌、特别是一张舒服的办公椅。  
远程工作的另一个不经常或不容易讨论的话题是心理健康。  
职业倦怠是一个现实而严重的问题，并且在 IT 行业普遍存在。  
信任和坦诚至关重要，只有这样团队成员才能够发现对工作不爽的同事，  
并及时帮助他们，包括寻求专业的帮助。孤独也是一个问题，  
让家庭和社交真正成为生活重心是需要你为之付出积极努力的。  
宠物、锻炼和亲近大自然也可以帮助改善心理健康。
