Capital One hosted their 3rd Agile Conference in December 2018 in
 Virginia. Among the guest speakers, Andrew Aitken, global open 
source strategy leader at Wipro, presented the state of open source 
and how it is becoming an industry-wide organizational keystone 
strategy in driving innovation and in retaining top talent.

Capital One在2018年的12月份，在弗吉尼亚州主板了第三届的敏捷大会。  
在特邀嘉宾当中，Andrew Aitken,一位在Wipro的全球开源战略专家，  
讲解了当前软件开源的现状，以及软件开源是如何成为驱动创新和组织顶尖人才中，  
成为整个行业的关键的。

Based on numerous surveys and conversations conducted with 
experienced clients, analysts, subject matter experts and peers, 
Aitken identified five leading benefits from adopting company 
wide open source strategies.

Most companies initiate their open source journey because of 
the perceived financial benefits, although this is almost never 
the reason why they keep using and scale open source. The main 
reason is what Aitken calls secondary innovation: 
once teams have ingested open source software, 
they naturally customize it to their needs and organizations 
by adding new features. These teams’ led customizations 
contribute to increasing the speed of new ideas and features to market.

The second benefit is teams’ ability to safely experiment 
and fail fast. When buying proprietary enterprise software, 
management and teams are pressured to make these products 
work because of the upfront investment, even if they no 
longer fit the purpose. With open source, teams feel 
empowered to download and experiment with various solutions. 
If they realize that it’s not the right open source for their 
project, they can experiment with different open source 
solutions and even consider proprietary software. 
Open source enables organizations to empower teams 
and provides teams the ability to fail fast and cheaply.

与经验丰富的客户、分析师、主题专家和同行进行了大量的调查和对话后，   
埃特金总结了全公司范围内推行开源策略的五大益处。  
大多数公司开始其开源之旅，往往是因为他们感觉可以省钱，  
但是，他们继续使用并推广开源战略的原因几乎都和财务方面的好处无关。  
  
最主要的原因是埃特金所说的二次创新是：  
一旦团队接受了开源软件，他们自然会定制新的功能，来满足他们和组织的个性化需求。  
这些由开发团队主导的个性化定制有助于加快新的想法和功能推向市场的速度。  
  
第二个好处是团队能够安全地进行实验并获得“快速失败”的能力。  
当公司购买企业级专有软件时，管理层和团队会因为前期投资而被迫使用这些产品，  
哪怕它们不再适合公司的商业目的。而通过开源，团队可以下载和试验各种解决方案。  
如果团队意识到这个开源软件不适合他们的项目，他们可以尝试不同的开源方案，  
甚至可以考虑转而购买专有软件。开源战略使组织能够赋能团队，  
为团队提供低成本快速失败的能力。  

```
The third benefit open source offers is a better way of building software. 
As organizations scale their teams and applications, 
they can create silos between product teams, which in turn can 
create equally as many development silos. When organizations 
strategically pair open source with inner-sourcing programs – creating 
internal networks of shared code, transparency, increased collective code 
ownership and collaboration – organizations and teams speed knowledge 
transfer, and produce greater quality code. This in turn leads to 
more reliable software.A bank headquartered on the west coast 
concluded after performing an analysis of their development that 
only 20 to 25 percent of their code was shared across the organization, 
and that 50 to 70 percent of their code was redundant, creating duplicate 
software. They selected six software development teams, created 
a shared code repository, and developed a process for exposing and 
sharing those code repositories to different groups within the organization. 
As an immediate result, their teams doubled the amount of code 
that was developed and shared, which directly reduced the amount 
and cost of redundant code.

```

开源的第三个好处是提高软件开发质量。  
随着一个组织的团队和应用不断拓展，产品团队之间会形成“孤岛”，  
进而形成同样多的开发孤岛。当组织战略性地将开源与内源项目  
（内源项目旨在创建一个组织内部网络，来共享代码、提高透明度、增加代码集体所有权和鼓励内部协作）  
结合起来之后，组织和团队就能加速知识转移，产生更高质量的代码，并最终发布更可靠的软件。  
一家总部设在美国西海岸的银行对其软件开发进行分析后得出结论，  
只有 20% 到 25% 的代码在整个组织内部共享，而 50% 到 70% 的代码是冗余的，结果产生重复的软件。  
他们选择了六个软件开发团队，创建了一个共享的代码库，  
并开发了一个将代码库公开分享给组织内不同团队的流程。    
立竿见影的结果是团队将开发和共享的代码量增加了一倍，直接减少了冗余代码的数量和成本。  


```
According to Aitken, the quality of the code increased dramatically 
because it was exposed to everyone inside the organization. 
This led to software developers taking more care in the software 
they were writing. Additionally, with new cross-functional teams 
contributing to the code base, there were some direct benefits 
from the product innovation perspective: teams developed new 
functionalities that they haven’t thought about previously.
```
按照埃特金的说法，由于代码对组织内每一个人开放，代码的质量得以大幅提升。  
这也使得软件开发人员在编写软件时更加用心。此外，随着新的跨职能团队持续不断丰富代码库，  
团队开发出了以前从未考虑过的新功能，这也是从产品创新的角度产生的直接成果。


```
The next two benefits relate to talent retention and competency development. 
80% of the organizations Aitken talked to shared that one of the key reasons 
why they got into open source is specifically to attract and 
retain the best software developer talent. Open source is evolving at 
a rapid pace, and developers learn new open source technologies every few years. 
In the competition for the best software development talent, 
companies now must advertise and show candidates that they are 
open source shops, and that they contribute to and open source 
their own software. Additionally, several studies showed that, 
through open source development and collaboration, developers 
become proficient faster, reducing the number of defects in their code base.
```

接下来的两个好处是保留人才和发展能力。在埃特金调研过的组织中，  
有 80% 认为他们采用开源的主要原因之一就是吸引和留住最优秀的软件开发人才。  
开源软件发展迅猛，开发人员每隔几年就要学习新的开源技术。  
在抢夺优秀程序员的竞争中，公司现在必须向应聘者宣传并展示自己的开源战略，  
公司自己开发软件并推广开源。此外，一些研究表明，通过开源发展和协作，  
开发人员的技能更为娴熟，其代码库中的缺陷数量也大为减少。
