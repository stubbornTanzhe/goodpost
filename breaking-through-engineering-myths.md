Key Takeaways
Examine yourself to determine if you believe in any common engineering myths
Accepting common myths can hold you back from growing your skills in new ways
Be intentional about taking action to progress, especially when it is uncomfortable
Always question and adapt your thinking to be in-line with what your goals are
Avoid thinking engineers must be a “certain way”
```

结论(译者:很有知乎体的风格啊;))
1. 问问你自己是不是相信这些谬论
2. 相信这些谬论不利于个人发展
3. 要有计划的采取行动来改进
4. 要根据目标来质疑和调整自己的思维方式
5. 不要相信工程师的刻板形象

There's an old and destructive engineering joke that goes like this:

"How do you tell the difference between an introverted and an extroverted engineer?
The extrovert will look at your shoes rather than their own."

Over time, jokes and stereotypes like these can be damaging because they can limit
our belief in what we feel is possible. For example, like many engineers I got
into the field because I was naturally good at math and science. I liked "right"
answers and found them in these topics. Eventually, I began to hold on to this desire,
this love for objectivity so much that I completely avoided subjects and skills
that were deemed subjective, creative, or artistic. I almost completely suppressed
that side of me. Now I feel like I’m playing catch up, but I’m still able to develop
these skills within myself. The good news is that engineers can and do become great
teachers, communicators, and leaders. We can break through these stereotypes with a
mindset shift that will allow us to grow and develop skills that perhaps we have suppressed.

有一个老的笑话是，你怎么判断一个工程师是外向还是内向？外向的工程师会看你的鞋，内向的工程师会看自己的鞋(译者:好冷)
这种笑话和刻板的印象随着时间的流逝，会限制我们对工程师的感受，以至于会造成一些伤害。比如，跟许多工程师一样，
我进入工程师领域，是因为我的数学和科学学的很好。只要涉及到这些领域，我总是尝试的找到那个"对"的答案。
最终，这种对客观性答案的执念，会让我避免任何主观性、创造性、艺术性的东西。我总是完全压制那一半的我(艺术性等)。
所以我现在感觉自己在奋力追赶，仍然能够发展这些内在的技能。好消息是，工程师是可以成为一个好老师、好的沟通者、好的领导的。
我们必须打破陈旧的观念，不再压制而是来开发自己那些(艺术性的)能力。

There are three common myths that often plague engineers that need to be debunked,
as they may be holding you back from reaching your full potential, especially if you are a
current or aspiring engineering leader. They are:


Engineers don’t have good communication skills
Engineers don’t make "natural" leaders
Engineers are very logical and not creative

Below we will dive into each of these myths and provide some actionable ideas
you can implement right away to start making a shift in your own life away from these limiting beliefs.
```
通常来说，有3个观念需要破除，这些观念可能会影响你发展自己的潜能，特别是处于一个工程师领导的角色中的时候：
工程师没有好的沟通技巧
工程师不会成为天然的领导者
工程师总是有逻辑性的，缺乏创造性
下边我们会分别深入的探讨这些不正确的观念，并且提供一些有可操作行的办法。你可以马上就开始行动，做一个改变，将这些限制从人生中去掉。

This myth goes with the belief that most engineers are introverts, 
and the corresponding belief that introverts are bad communicators. 
The truth is, both introverts and extroverts can be fantastic 
communicators, as these skills can be learned and developed over time. 
Some of my favorite people to listen and talk to in the entire world 
are introverts. Perhaps most famously in recent years, Susan Cain is 
developing what she calls the "Quiet Revolution" to help the world 
recognize the power of introverts in such a noisy world. As an introvert, 
she has overcome massive anxiety around public speaking to become a 
prolific speaker. In the engineering world, you can look to great leaders 
like Bill Gates (Microsoft), Steve Wozniak (Apple), and Larry Page (Google).

The natural behavioral types of introvert vs. extrovert have nothing to 
do with actual ability to communicate, but rather identify how people 
gain energy from interpersonal interaction (and where they exist on 
the spectrum). Humans are naturally social beings and we feel purpose 
as we develop connections with others. Thus, developing an array of 
communication skills is necessary for everyone to be happy and healthy.
```
这个谬论在于人们认为工程师都是内向性格，而内向性格都不是一个好的沟通者。  
实际上内向并不等于不会沟通。内向外向的人都可以通过训练来得到沟通技巧。  
一些我喜欢的并且能够跟整个世界对话的人，都是内向的人。  
在工程师的世界里，你可以看到比尔盖茨，乔布斯等，都是内向的人。    
内向或者外向，是人类的行为方式而已。和实际沟通的能力没关系。  
人类是自然社会的，我们与其他人的加强关联，是有目的性的。因此，发展沟通能力，  
是每个人获取幸福和健康的必备技能之一。

Practice Listening
Developing communication skills is a broad idea that covers 
a lot of ground. To start, engineers can develop their own 
communication abilities by really focusing on the skill of 
listening. An important quote to remember is:

Seek first to understand, then to be understood.

-Stephen R. Covey

The important thing to practice is truly seeking to understand 
what others are trying to communicate to us. We can’t be 
listening only to come up with a response if we want to be 
effective listeners. Do you see the difference? Underneath 
the action we take, we must truly care about the other person 
and what they have to say.  You can often tell if someone 
doesn’t care about what you have to say, and the same is true 
as others are talking to you.

Listening Activity: Start up a conversation with a colleague 
and ask them an open-ended question. The question can be as 
simple as "How was your weekend?" or "How do you think we can 
solve this problem?" Then listen to them for two minutes 
straight without making any verbal response other than simple 
acknowledgements. Don’t interrupt to ask more questions. 
Just listen. See what you learn.

Simplify Communication
```
加强沟通技巧是一个很大的话题，包含很多方面。  
最开始的话，工程师可以多听。有一句谚语说的好:"先理解别人，然后才能被理解"  
重要的事情是真正寻求了解他人试图与我们交流的内容。  
如果我们想成为有效的倾听者，我们不能只听回应。   
你看得到差别吗？ 在我们采取的行动下，我们必须真正关心对方和他们说的话。  
你经常可以说出某人不在乎你在说什么，就像你不在乎别人在说什么一样。
可以和一些同事聊一些开放性的话题，比如“你的周末过的怎么样？”  
“你认为我们应该怎么处理这个问题？”然后就是倾听两分钟。除了微微点头确认以外，什么也不回应。  
不打断，就是一直听。然后看看收获了什么。    

```
One common hiccup in engineering communication is explaining detailed, 
complex ideas in detailed, complex ways. Engineers understand the whole 
picture and are excited to share what they know. Instead of clarity and 
collaboration, this can often lead to confusion. Reflect on this quote 
from Albert Einstein:

If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.

Especially when communicating with non-technical people and working across 
teams, get rid of jargon and share ideas using concepts the other person 
can simply understand. Often this includes using analogies or comparisons 
that they can relate to.

Technical Communication Activity: Take the six-year-old test. Find a complex 
idea or concept that you know very well and try and explain it to a child or 
someone else who would be completely unfamiliar with it. See if they understand 
and can explain it back to you. Try teaching the same idea to at least three 
different people and see how you improve.
```
一个常见的场景是，一个工程师通常要在沟通中解释复杂的东西，复杂的细节，复杂的想法，复杂的办法。  
有的时候越解释越乱。所以这里有一个经典的引用(来自爱因斯坦)是，"如果你给6岁孩子解释不通，说明你自己没懂"  
尤其是跟非技术人员在交流或者跨团队工作的时候，不要使用工程术语，多使用简单的，别人能够理解的概念，  
来说清楚事情。通常如类比，或者他们身边的能够理解的东西，去解释沟通。  
实践：找一个你很懂的领域，然后找一个6岁的小朋友，或者对你熟知领域一窍不通的人。来讲解，看看他们是不是真正理解了，  
并且能够反讲给你自己。找三个人挨个讲一讲，来练习。
