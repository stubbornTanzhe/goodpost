There's an old and destructive engineering joke that goes like this:

"How do you tell the difference between an introverted and an extroverted engineer?
The extrovert will look at your shoes rather than their own."

Over time, jokes and stereotypes like these can be damaging because they can limit
our belief in what we feel is possible. For example, like many engineers I got
into the field because I was naturally good at math and science. I liked "right"
answers and found them in these topics. Eventually, I began to hold on to this desire,
this love for objectivity so much that I completely avoided subjects and skills
that were deemed subjective, creative, or artistic. I almost completely suppressed
that side of me. Now I feel like I’m playing catch up, but I’m still able to develop
these skills within myself. The good news is that engineers can and do become great
teachers, communicators, and leaders. We can break through these stereotypes with a
mindset shift that will allow us to grow and develop skills that perhaps we have suppressed.
```

有一个老的笑话是，你怎么判断一个工程师是外向还是内向？外向的工程师会看你的鞋，内向的工程师会看自己的鞋(译者:好冷)
这种笑话和刻板的印象随着时间的流逝，会限制我们对工程师的感受，以至于会造成一些伤害。比如，跟许多工程师一样，
我进入工程师领域，是因为我的数学和科学学的很好。只要涉及到这些领域，我总是尝试的找到那个"对"的答案。
最终，这种对客观性答案的执念，会让我避免任何主观性、创造性、艺术性的东西。我总是完全压制那一半的我(艺术性等)。
所以我现在感觉自己在奋力追赶，仍然能够发展这些内在的技能。好消息是，工程师是可以成为一个好老师、好的沟通者、好的领导的。
我们必须打破陈旧的观念，不再压制而是来开发自己那些(艺术性的)能力。

```
There are three common myths that often plague engineers that need to be debunked,
as they may be holding you back from reaching your full potential, especially if you are a
current or aspiring engineering leader. They are:


Engineers don’t have good communication skills
Engineers don’t make "natural" leaders
Engineers are very logical and not creative

Below we will dive into each of these myths and provide some actionable ideas
you can implement right away to start making a shift in your own life away from these limiting beliefs.
```
通常来说，有3个观念需要破除，这些观念可能会影响你发展自己的潜能，特别是处于一个工程师领导的角色中的时候：
工程师没有好的沟通技巧
工程师不会成为天然的领导者
工程师总是有逻辑性的，缺乏创造性
下边我们会分别深入的探讨这些不正确的观念，并且提供一些有可操作行的办法。你可以马上就开始行动，做一个改变，将这些限制从人生中去掉。


```
This myth goes with the belief that most engineers are introverts, 
and the corresponding belief that introverts are bad communicators. 
The truth is, both introverts and extroverts can be fantastic 
communicators, as these skills can be learned and developed over time. 
Some of my favorite people to listen and talk to in the entire world 
are introverts. Perhaps most famously in recent years, Susan Cain is 
developing what she calls the "Quiet Revolution" to help the world 
recognize the power of introverts in such a noisy world. As an introvert, 
she has overcome massive anxiety around public speaking to become a 
prolific speaker. In the engineering world, you can look to great leaders 
like Bill Gates (Microsoft), Steve Wozniak (Apple), and Larry Page (Google).

The natural behavioral types of introvert vs. extrovert have nothing to 
do with actual ability to communicate, but rather identify how people 
gain energy from interpersonal interaction (and where they exist on 
the spectrum). Humans are naturally social beings and we feel purpose 
as we develop connections with others. Thus, developing an array of 
communication skills is necessary for everyone to be happy and healthy.
```
这个谬论在于人们认为工程师都是内向性格，而内向性格都不是一个好的沟通者。  
实际上内向并不等于不会沟通。内向外向的人都可以通过训练来得到沟通技巧。  
一些我喜欢的并且能够跟整个世界对话的人，都是内向的人。  
在工程师的世界里，你可以看到比尔盖茨，乔布斯等，都是内向的人。    
内向或者外向，是人类的行为方式而已。和实际沟通的能力没关系。  
人类是自然社会的，我们与其他人的加强关联，是有目的性的。因此，发展沟通能力，  
是每个人获取幸福和健康的必备技能之一。  


```
Practice Listening
Developing communication skills is a broad idea that covers 
a lot of ground. To start, engineers can develop their own 
communication abilities by really focusing on the skill of 
listening. An important quote to remember is:

Seek first to understand, then to be understood.

-Stephen R. Covey

The important thing to practice is truly seeking to understand 
what others are trying to communicate to us. We can’t be 
listening only to come up with a response if we want to be 
effective listeners. Do you see the difference? Underneath 
the action we take, we must truly care about the other person 
and what they have to say.  You can often tell if someone 
doesn’t care about what you have to say, and the same is true 
as others are talking to you.

Listening Activity: Start up a conversation with a colleague 
and ask them an open-ended question. The question can be as 
simple as "How was your weekend?" or "How do you think we can 
solve this problem?" Then listen to them for two minutes 
straight without making any verbal response other than simple 
acknowledgements. Don’t interrupt to ask more questions. 
Just listen. See what you learn.

Simplify Communication
```
加强沟通技巧是一个很大的话题，包含很多方面。  
最开始的话，工程师可以多听。有一句谚语说的好:"先理解别人，然后才能被理解"  
重要的事情是真正寻求了解他人试图与我们交流的内容。  
如果我们想成为有效的倾听者，我们不能只听回应。   
你看得到差别吗？ 在我们采取的行动下，我们必须真正关心对方和他们说的话。  
你经常可以说出某人不在乎你在说什么，就像你不在乎别人在说什么一样。
可以和一些同事聊一些开放性的话题，比如“你的周末过的怎么样？”  
“你认为我们应该怎么处理这个问题？”然后就是倾听两分钟。除了微微点头确认以外，什么也不回应。  
不打断，就是一直听。然后看看收获了什么。    

```
One common hiccup in engineering communication is explaining detailed, 
complex ideas in detailed, complex ways. Engineers understand the whole 
picture and are excited to share what they know. Instead of clarity and 
collaboration, this can often lead to confusion. Reflect on this quote 
from Albert Einstein:

If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.

Especially when communicating with non-technical people and working across 
teams, get rid of jargon and share ideas using concepts the other person 
can simply understand. Often this includes using analogies or comparisons 
that they can relate to.

Technical Communication Activity: Take the six-year-old test. Find a complex 
idea or concept that you know very well and try and explain it to a child or 
someone else who would be completely unfamiliar with it. See if they understand 
and can explain it back to you. Try teaching the same idea to at least three 
different people and see how you improve.
```
一个常见的场景是，一个工程师通常要在沟通中解释复杂的东西，复杂的细节，复杂的想法，复杂的办法。  
有的时候越解释越乱。所以这里有一个经典的引用(来自爱因斯坦)是，"如果你给6岁孩子解释不通，说明你自己没懂"  
尤其是跟非技术人员在交流或者跨团队工作的时候，不要使用工程术语，多使用简单的，别人能够理解的概念，  
来说清楚事情。通常如类比，或者他们身边的能够理解的东西，去解释沟通。  
实践：找一个你很懂的领域，然后找一个6岁的小朋友，或者对你熟知领域一窍不通的人。来讲解，看看他们是不是真正理解了，  
并且能够反讲给你自己。找三个人挨个讲一讲，来练习。


```
This myth follows an even more generalized myth that leaders are born, not made.
Research on leadership development suggests that this simply is not true,
and in fact 70 percent of leadership ability is the result of lessons learned through life experiences.

A foundational concept of leadership development is often referred to as "leadership readiness."
It is a belief inside someone that they are truly ready, willing, and able to become a leader.
People who believe this about themselves can develop much more quickly, and this isn’t surprising.
This idea is very much in-line with other research done by Carol Dweck about having a "growth"
mindset versus a "fixed" mindset so that we believe we can continue to develop and change throughout our lives.
```
这个谬论的背后有一个更普遍的谬论，就是领导是天生的，不是后天培养的。
关于领导力的调研很容易就证明这个谬论是错的，并且实际上70%的领导能力是通过人生经验所学习的结果。
关于领导力发展，有一个基础性的概念叫做"领导力的就绪"，即心理上是否做好了成为领导的准备。
相信这个理念的人会非常快速的发展领导力，并且这个现象也不吃惊。
这个理念，于carol dweck做的一个关于成长型性格和修复型性格的研究，是有内在关联的。
所以我们相信在人生中，可以持续的发展和改变自己。

```
One of the ways to discover that we are capable of leadership is to identify the strengths
that we have and find ways to utilize them. There are a lot of free and paid assessments out there,
such as CliftonStrengths by Gallup to help you do this, but a very simple approach is to
ask people who know you well.

Go ahead – ask the ten people in your life who know you better than anyone else
what they think your top three personal strengths are. Likely, you will agree with a lot of what they say.
They may also share with you things that you don’t currently believe about yourself,
but because others are suggesting it, you may start to believe a little bit more.

Crushing Limiting Belief Activity: This may seem a bit weird, but stay with me.
Take about five minutes and jot down a quick list of what you consider to be your weaknesses.
Then grab a piece of paper or note card and write down each of those "weaknesses"
that you identified that is actually a limiting belief. Take that paper with the list of limiting beliefs
and rip it up. Throw it into the air. Make a mess. Show those beliefs you don’t accept them.
For example, my weakness might be that I tend to suppress my emotions which can lead to
less connection in my relationships. A limiting belief I used to accept was that I was not a good writer.
You may or may not agree with that, but at least I am pushing through and practicing my skills!
I would write that on a note card and rip it up. I promise, it feels good.
```
如果想挖掘我们是否有领导力，有一个办法是我们可以寻找我们的优势。
比如CliftonStrengths就可以做这个，只是需要找一些了解你的人来询问。
来吧，找你一生中10个最了解你的人，并且他们知道你个人3个优点。当然，你可能大部分都会很认同。
他们也会跟你分享一些你可能当下不认为自己所拥有的，但是别人说了你可能就会逐渐相信。

打破限制性的想法：这看起来有点奇怪，但是先别走。
花5分钟，然后想一下哪些你认为是你的弱点的事。
然后找一张纸，写下来你认为是真正限制了你的那些"弱点"。然后把这张纸撕掉，扔到空中。
比如，我的一个弱点就是我倾向于压制自己的情绪，这会降低我的人际关系。
一个限制的想法是我经常认为我不会是一个好的写作者。你可能不相信，但我正在练习我的写作能力。
我会把这个写到纸上，并撕掉，我保证这很爽。

```
The fact of the matter is that people rarely make huge changes in their lives,
but people do change. It happens when we can increase self-awareness and have “ah-ha”
moments or epiphanies that help us see ourselves and our situations in a new light.
That’s really how we change our mindsets, which then drives our behaviors in new ways.
I’ve seen people who were so bent on blaming others that they became so toxic and were
about to be fired. Yet they were able to create just enough space to realize they were
part of the problem and began focusing on what they could change, rather than blaming
everyone else. It’s transformational.Mindset Adjustment Activity: Identify the largest
work challenge you are facing right now. Write down what you think the root cause of
the problem is. Then, write down 2-3 things you can do personally to make things better
(this is not about you taking action to fix other people – focus on you).
Then, stay focused on your own ability to help the cause rather than what others are/aren't doning.
```
实际上，人们在一生中很少做一些重大的改变。但是改变总是存在的。
当我们增加对自我的意识，或者开心大笑，或者顿悟，都会帮助我们在新的角度去看待自己和我们的处境。
改变认知，就会改变我们的行为。我见过有些人总是责备别人，所以他们变得暴躁，以至于要被开除。
但是他们是可以先意识到自己是不是也是这个问题的责任之一，然后先聚焦于什么可以被改变，而不是责备别人。
这就是改变的思维模式：试别你当前最大的工作挑战。写下来你认为的根因，然后，写下来2-3件事你可以让这些事情变得更好的。
这不是让你去要求别人，只聚焦你自己。然后，一直关注在你能改变根因的能力上。不要管其他人是否做的到。

Myth: Engineers Are Very Logical and Not Creative
This one seems to make sense – if engineers were creative,
wouldn’t they have decided to be artists, writers,
or some other “Fine Arts” profession? Wrong! The key word in being creative is right there
– to create! Engineers create products, services, and processes that influence people every day.
Whether your work goes into consumer applications, devices, or machines,
the end product of engineering work is used by other people.
If engineers suppressed their creativity, they would miss out on a lot of
insights into ways to solve problems than they otherwise would.Every day,
engineers need to find new ways to think outside the box to tackle new challenges.
They have the fabulous opportunity and responsibility of imagining ways in which
the world could be different and then creating ways to make that happen.
That is at the heart of what creativity is all about and it should be inspiring
and exciting for engineers. For example, engineering innovations have been a big part of
healthcare improvement over the years. From data analysis to efficient software systems,
to surgery machines, to providing treatment tracking and recommendations,
engineering truly saves lives daily.
```
工程师特别具有逻辑性，所以没有创新
这个看起来有点意义，如果工程师是有创新性的，那么他们难道不会决定去做艺术家、作家，
或者其他艺术性的专家吗？错！创新性的关键字就在于：创作！工程师创建了产品、服务，并且每天都在影响人们。
无论你的工作是跟消费者应用相关的，或者是设备、机器，工程师的最终产品是让其他人使用的。
如果工程师压制了他们的创新性，他们会缺少很多解决问题的远见。每一天，工程师都始图使用新的
方式来处理挑战。他们拥有着优秀的机会，对于让世界变得不同，并且使之变得可能，对于工程师来说是有这个责任心的。
这就是创新的核心，并且会给工程师鼓舞和兴奋。举个例子，在健康领域，工程上的创新一直占比很高。
从软件系统的有效数据分析，到治疗的仪器，到提供治疗追踪和建议，工程师一直在在治病救人。
