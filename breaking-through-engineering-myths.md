Key Takeaways
Examine yourself to determine if you believe in any common engineering myths
Accepting common myths can hold you back from growing your skills in new ways
Be intentional about taking action to progress, especially when it is uncomfortable
Always question and adapt your thinking to be in-line with what your goals are
Avoid thinking engineers must be a “certain way”
```

结论(译者:很有知乎体的风格啊;))
1. 问问你自己是不是相信这些谬论
2. 相信这些谬论不利于个人发展
3. 要有计划的采取行动来改进
4. 要根据目标来质疑和调整自己的思维方式
5. 不要相信工程师的刻板形象

There's an old and destructive engineering joke that goes like this:

"How do you tell the difference between an introverted and an extroverted engineer?
The extrovert will look at your shoes rather than their own."

Over time, jokes and stereotypes like these can be damaging because they can limit
our belief in what we feel is possible. For example, like many engineers I got
into the field because I was naturally good at math and science. I liked "right"
answers and found them in these topics. Eventually, I began to hold on to this desire,
this love for objectivity so much that I completely avoided subjects and skills
that were deemed subjective, creative, or artistic. I almost completely suppressed
that side of me. Now I feel like I’m playing catch up, but I’m still able to develop
these skills within myself. The good news is that engineers can and do become great
teachers, communicators, and leaders. We can break through these stereotypes with a
mindset shift that will allow us to grow and develop skills that perhaps we have suppressed.

有一个老的笑话是，你怎么判断一个工程师是外向还是内向？外向的工程师会看你的鞋，内向的工程师会看自己的鞋(译者:好冷)
这种笑话和刻板的印象随着时间的流逝，会限制我们对工程师的感受，以至于会造成一些伤害。比如，跟许多工程师一样，
我进入工程师领域，是因为我的数学和科学学的很好。只要涉及到这些领域，我总是尝试的找到那个"对"的答案。
最终，这种对客观性答案的执念，会让我避免任何主观性、创造性、艺术性的东西。我总是完全压制那一半的我(艺术性等)。
所以我现在感觉自己在奋力追赶，仍然能够发展这些内在的技能。好消息是，工程师是可以成为一个好老师、好的沟通者、好的领导的。
我们必须打破陈旧的观念，不再压制而是来开发自己那些(艺术性的)能力。
