Product-minded engineers are developers with lots of interest in the 
product itself.They want to understand why decisions are made, how 
people use the product, and love to be involved in making product 
decisions. They're someone who would likely make a good product 
manager if they ever decide to give up the joy of engineering. I've 
worked with many great product-minded engineers and consider 
myself to be this kind of developer. At companies building world-class 
products, product-minded engineers take teams to a new level of impact.

具有产品思维的工程师，自己是开发者，同时对产品本身是有很多兴趣的。  
他们会想要理解决策背后的原因，人们会怎么使用这个产品，并且很乐意参与产品的决策。  
他们中的一些人，甚至会放弃工程师的乐趣，而去成为一个好的产品经理。  
我之前和很多具有产品思维的工程师工作过，并且我自己也是这样的工程师。  
如果一个公司正在开发世界级的软件产品，那么具有产品思维的工程师，会使团队具有更高阶的影响力。  
  
```
1. Proactive with product ideas/opinions

Product-minded engineers don’t settle for getting a specification and 
jumping to implement it. They think about other ideas and approach 
the product manager with these. They often challenge existing 
specifications, suggesting alternative product approaches, that might 
work better.
```
  
#### 1. 主动参与产品的头脑风暴、意见收集
具有产品思维的工程师，不会满足于拿到一个文档然后就略带草率的实现它。  
他们会思考，并且带着自己的思考去跟产品精力交流。  
他们会经常对现有的文档进行挑战，给出更好的替代性的方法。  
  
```
2. Interest in the business, user behavior and data on this

When coming with ideas, product-minded engineers don't just get 
these from thin air. They take the time to understand how the business 
works, how the product fits in, and what its goals are. They are also 
empathetic about how the product makes users feel and how those 
users benefit from using this product. They often dive straight to data 
about business and user metrics, getting their hands on this data 
however they can. They might access it directly - if this is possible - or 
approach the product manager or data scientists to get this kind of 
information. They do this because of their curious nature. This is the 
next trait I've observed.
```
  
#### 2. 对商业、用户行为和数据的兴趣
具有产品思维的工程师，他们的思考和想法，都不是凭空而来的。  
他们会花时间去理解商业的运转，产品配合商业的运转，以及最终的目标所在。  
他们会去换位思考产品给用户的感受以及用户最终通过使用这个产品获得的价值。  
他们通常会深入研究商业和用户各种纬度返回的统计数据，并且竭尽全力的获取这些数据。  
如果可能的话，他们会直接拿到数据，或者找产品经理或数据科学家去要这些信息。  
并且可能就是处于好奇才做这些事情。这是我观察到的下一个特征  

```
3. Curiosity and a keen interest in "why?"

Product-minded engineers like to understand the "why?" behind all 
things. Why build this feature for the product, why not the other one? 
Why ship this first milestone, instead of choosing another one, that's a 
lot simpler to build? How will things be measured - why don't we 
choose a more thorough way to measure things?

They are autonomous in finding answers they can, by themselves. They 
turn to the product manager and other people in the business for other, 
product-related questions. Even though they ask many questions, 
doing this frequently, they manage not to annoy people, as they've 
built up strong relationships with them.
```
#### 3. 好奇心和对“为什么”的兴趣
具有产品思维的工程师，对于任何事情，都倾向于去理解其背后的原因。  
为什么给这个产品构建这个特性？为什么不选择另一个特性？  
为什么要发布这个里程碑，而不是选择另一个相对简单的多的里程碑？    
关于度量的方法 - 为什么我们不选择另外一种更彻底的方式去度量？  

他们会自主的找到他们能找到的答案。  
他们也会去找产品经理和商业市场相关的人，咨询产品相关的问题。  
虽然可能会很频繁的问很多问题，由于跟这些人建立了良好的关系，
这些工程师是不会打扰到产品经理们的。  


```
4. Strong communicators and great relationships with non-engineers

Product-minded engineers like talking with people outside 
engineering, learning about what and why they do. They are smooth 
communicators, making it clear they're interested in learning more 
about how other disciplines work. I frequently see them grabbing 
coffee, lunch, or doing a hallway chat with non-engineers.
```

#### 4. 强大的沟通能力，与非工程师同事建立良好的关系  
具有产品思维的工程师喜欢与工程师之外的人们交流，  
学习了解他们在做什么以及为什么他们做的原因。  
他们善于沟通，很明显，他们会对学习其他学科工作有浓厚兴趣。  
我经常看到他们与其他领域的同事们一起喝咖啡，一起吃午饭，以及在走廊上聊天  


```
5. Offering product/engineering tradeoffs upfront

Because they have a strong understanding of the product "why," as 
well as the engineering side of things, they can bring suggestions that 
few other people can. For example, when scoping the effort to build the 
product, the engineering effort to build a key feature might be 
significant. Many engineers would start to look for ways to reduce the 
effort and try to figure out what the impact of the reduced effort would 
mean for the feature itself.

Product-minded engineers attack this problem from both angles: both 
looking for engineering tradeoffs and what the product impact is. 
They also start making product tradeoffs, evaluating the engineering impact. 
They often go back to the product manager, suggesting a completely 
different feature to be built, given the product impact would be similar, 
but the engineering effort vastly smaller.

Juggling both the product and engineering tradeoffs and the impact 
of each is a unique strength product-minded engineers have. They 
can quickly go back-and-forth between the two sides of the same coin: 
product features and engineering effort and tradeoffs. Because they do 
it all in their head, using their engineering and product insights, they 
get to valuable conclusions remarkably quickly.
